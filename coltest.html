The software used in most present-day newsrooms still measures column inches to give reporters and editors an estimate on how much space a story will take up on a page. Reporters usually refer to story lengths in inches, which actually refers to how many column inches a story takes up. Although it varies, it is generally agreed upon that there are 25-35 words in a column inch.<br />
<br />
Newspaper pages are laid out on a grid that consists of a margin on 4 sides, a number of vertical columns and space between columns (called gutters). Broadsheet newspaper pages in the United States usually have 6 columns, while tabloid sized publications have 5 columns.<br />
<br />
Column width<br />
<br />
In the United States, a common newspaper column measurement is about 11 picas wide (or about 1.83 inches), though this measure varies from paper to paper and in other countries. The examples in this article follow this assumption for illustration purposes only.
